## Does it only work with HTML?

It works with HTML, but you can also use it to generate templates of any language, like Markdown.

## How big is Squirrelly?

Squirrelly is about 3KB gzipped, which is quite lightweight for a template engine library.

## Why should I use Squirrelly instead of another template engine like Handlebars or Pug?

Squirrelly has a number of features that set it apart from the competition:

* It's faster than most templating engines
* It supports user-defined helpers and native helpers
* It supports filters
* It supports partials
* It's incredibly lightweight: in comparison: the full version only weighs about **3 KB gzipped**, compared to Pug's **237 KB** and Handlebars' **21.5 KB**
* It works with other languages than HTML
* It's not whitespace sensitive
