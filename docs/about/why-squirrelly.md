- Faster than most templating engines
- Supports user-defined helpers and native helpers
- Supports filters
- Supports partials

- Works with other languages than HTML
- Not white-space sensitive, but white-space-trimming configurable
- Syntax accessible to non-JavaScript programmers
- Supports comments and quotes containing ending delimiter (e.g. `{{! /* commented out {{something}} \*/}}`)
