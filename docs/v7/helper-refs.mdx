title: Helper References
---

A helper reference is a reference that points to data created by a helper. For example, when looping through an object using the `foreach` helper, you can access the value of the current child key by using `{{@index}}`

## Basic syntax

```sqrl
{{@referencekey}}
```

Helper references are always in the scope of its parent helper, unless you use scoping or ids.

## Scoping

After the `@`, place one `../` for each level of helper you want to go back.

```
{{@../referencekey}}
```

## IDs

If you specified an id when you created the helper, like this:

```text
{{helper(params) someid}}
{{/helper}}
```

Then you can reference that helper like this: `{{@someid:helperref}}`
