Helpers are an easy way to include logic within a template. Conditionals, looping, and partials are all implemented using helpers.

## Basic Syntax

```
{{@helpername(parameters) => [var1, var2]}}

Content goes here

{{#helperblock}}

{{/helpername}}
```

You can have as many blocks as you want within a helper.

## Example

```
{{@portfolio( {userID: 3838357} )}}
Joe Edrick
{{#tagline}}
Cool Coder Person
{{#hobbies}}
Eating delicious food
{{#img}}
{{@user.img}}
{{/portfolio}}
```

## Self-Closing Helpers

Self-Closing Helpers are helpers that have no content, and are just called with parameters.

### Basic Syntax

```
{{@helpername(parameters) /}}
```

### Examples

```
{{@include("mypartial")/}}
