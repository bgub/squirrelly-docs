A global reference refers to a data value passed in to your template. They are always evaluated on the top-level scope, and can be placed anywhere in your template.

## Basic syntax:

```sqrl
{{referencekey}}
```

## Overview

Put a global reference between the opening and closing delimeters (by default `{{`and `}}`).
Since Squirrelly templates parse into JavaScript, you can write a reference using dot notation: `<p>This is the child of an object: {{user.lastName}}` or bracket notation: `<p>This is the child of an object: {{user['lastName']}}`.

<Hint type="warning">

There can be spaces after the tag start (default {`{{`}) and before a tag close (default {`}}`}), but any reference that doesn't point to an actual value, like {`{{hi people}}`}, will make your code break!
