Filters let you pipe content through some predefined functions.

## Basic Syntax

```sqrl
```

Squirrelly has a filter syntax similar to Nunjucks or Swig. Just put a `|` and then the filter name. You can pipe a reference to multiple filters if you want.

## Example

```sqrl
{{mystring | reverse | capitalize}}
```

<Hint type="note" title="Defining Filters">

Remember, you'll need to [define each filter](define-filter) before you use it.

</Hint>

## The `safe` flag

To disable autoescaping, you can write

```sqrl
{{myreference | safe}}
```

This isn't a true filter, it just acts as a flag to let Squirrelly know not to autoescape.
