Squirrelly is a template engine written in JavaScript.

With Squirrelly, you can write templates that are blazing fast and can be rendered in milliseconds, server-side or client-side.

Squirrelly doesn't just limit you to HTML--you can use it with any language, and custom delimeters make it so there aren't parsing errors. It's also tiny (**~4 KB gzipped**), has **0 dependencies**, and is **blazing fast**.
